The project is highly started on an experimental note whether an iOS app can enchance the shopping experience of a blind person or not. 

The basic idea of the project is to keep the shopping experience for blind people as individualistic as possible. To put a seed to our idea, we have started working on creating an iOS app. The app requires the blind person to have a handy barcode scanner all through the shopping. The app connects with the barcode scanner through bluetooth. When the connected barcode scanner scans the barcode, the scanned barcode will be sent to the app. The app uses the barcode to search the publicly available Walmart database and retrieves the product information. Finally, we let a voice-over technology to speak out the product information.

As we are using socker scanner for our project, we used the Socket Scanner SDK for bluetooth connection. The Walmart datbase we are using is for experimental purposes. We may change to the other publicly available database in the future.
